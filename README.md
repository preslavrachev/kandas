# Kandas
Kandas is an early stage proof-of-concept port of the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library for the Kotlin language.

**NOTE:** At the moment, this project is more a learning experiment than anything else. Fedback and community support are more than welcome, though.

## Motivation
The Kotlin is becoming increasingly popular and appears in many fields, traditionally dominated by other technologies. Yet, is still a hidden gem when it comes to data science. The potential of the language is there, what is missing are a few of the good Python/R libraries that data scientists and data engineers have come to use and love.

## Why Pandas?
Pandas is one of the most widely used libraries for data analysis and exploration. It is one of the standard choices in every data scientist's toolkit. What makes Pandas so powerful, besides the pure performance, is its intuituve and easy to grasp data analysis sysntax.
